# CalPal-CS 386 Project Repo

CalPal is a fitness, budget, and calorie traker website that is a part of an undergraduate student led group project for CS 386. The website is primarily geared towards college students due to their busy schedules and lack of convient healthy food options often making it difficult for them to maintain healthy eating. CalPal solves these aformentioned problem by; tracking a students meals and activity to help them reach fitness goals, helping students find healthy food thats safe for them to eat within their budget, and monitoring their intake of macros. Each of these features are broken down in the website into tabs which take in input from users to customize their fitness experience. The goal of the project primarily is to provide project development experience to the undergraduate students to prepare them for other projects they may work on in the future.
